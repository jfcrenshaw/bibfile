The bib file is automatically generated by the [Better Bibtex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) extension for Zotero.
Whenever the bib file is updated, it is automatically pushed to Github, using the automatic git export described [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/exporting/auto/).
